# Environment Setup
Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10
 
**Step 1**:
Install the MongoDB Community Edition:

- [Windows](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows) or [macOS](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

The Community Edition lets you run MongoDB locally on your computer. If you want to work with MongoDB on the cloud, use MongoDB's Atlas managed database service.  
Optionally, install MongoDB Compass as a GUI for MongoDB databases, using connection string `mongodb://localhost:27017` for local development.

Then, make sure that MongoDB is running:
`brew services start mongodb` on macOS and `mongod` on Windows

**Step 2**:
Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server.git`

**Step 3**:  
> [!NOTE]
> It is best practice to use a virtual environment. We have been using venv, which comes bundled with Python.
> To activate the venv virtual environment, navigate to the root of the project directory and run: `source ./venv/Scripts/activate` on macOS. To deactivate, run `deactivate`.
>
> Alternatively, use pipenv virtual environment: `pipenv shell`

Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
There is a separate `requirements-dev.txt` for installing dev dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

**Step 4**:
Run the following command in the terminal: `python src/application.py`

**Step 5**:
Open the URL in your browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

**Step 6**:
Run `python src/insert_data.py` to create a food collection and exercise collection in the test database. This food data is used for the Calories form.


### Alternatively, deploy using Docker Compose:  
Prerequisites:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

**Step 1**:
Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/1360119047/calorieApp_server.git`

**Step 2**:
Run with Docker: `docker compose up --build`

**Step 3**:
Open the URL in your browser: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`


# Testing
We primarily test the `application.py` module, the Flask API interface for which the client side interacts. If HTTP requests to application.py endpoints 
return expected values, then we can reasonably assume that other backend code that is customer-facing is working. That is what we most care about.

Unit tests are located in `tests/test_application.py`. To run tests and generate a code coverage report:

```pytest --cov=application --cov-report=html```

Note that coverage HTML is written to directory htmlcov in the same location the command is run. Navigate to htmlcov and open index.html in a browser.

# Roadmap and Future Ideas

1. Improve frontend even more.
2. Improve user profile with more information and customizable options. Make profiles viewable to friends and other users.
3. Provide user stats and trends for diet and activity.
4. Improve the food and activity selection forms with a more efficient search tool for a better experience.
5. Make goals more customizable. Add profile badges and other rewards for hitting goals.
6. Add functionality to workout enrollment feature. Incorporate workout planner and other progress metrics.
7. Implement a recommendation system for foods, activities, calorie goals, etc.
